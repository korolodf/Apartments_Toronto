This repository contains the data and code used to produce my paper, A Spatial look at Toronto Apartment Building A Spatial look at Toronto Apartment Building External Maintenance.

"Sin and The City: Investigating the Number and Sex of Victims of Crimes Against the Person in Toronto Across 2014-2021."

Here I investigated how the number of victims of crime in Toronto has changed over time, if it has increased over time, which categories of crimes against the person are most prevalent and if sex differences are apparent across different forms of crime.

This repo is organised as follows...
