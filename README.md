This repository contains the data and code used to produce my paper, A Spatial look at Toronto Apartment Building External Maintenance.

Here I investigated how the upkeep of apartment buildings varies across the city of Toronto, based upon RentSafeTO data on scores for building cladding, the presence of graffiti, grounds and walkways.

This repo is organised as follows...

inputs: Included in inputs is the raw data I downloaded from The City of Toronto - titled "raw_df.csv" within the data folder. 

outputs/paper: Included in outputs is both the Quarto and PDF document of my paper, Apartments_Toronto.qmd / pdf. It also contains the bibliography text document and a data folder containing the cleaned data used for analysis in clean_df.csv.

scripts: The scripts folder contains code to simulate and unit test data, download data and clean data (all named based upon their function). 

Thanks for visiting my repo!
